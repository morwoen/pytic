# PyTic
Tic Tac Toe bot using machine learning. The decisions are made based on probability of winning given the current field. It also tries to learn from both personal and oponent's perspective. The bot has a simple web based UI to allow people to play with it. I have also included a data file (`data.pkl`) with some training data (so it doesn't start completely unaware), but it is nowhere near enough.

## Getting Started
1. You need to have [Python](https://www.python.org/) 2.7 (might work with 3 as well) and [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) installed
2. (Optional) Install and create a [`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/)
3. Install the requirements by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Start the web application: `python main.py`
5. You should be able to access the application on [`http://localhost:5000`](http://localhost:5000)
